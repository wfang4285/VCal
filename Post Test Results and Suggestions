Analysis:
People seem to agree this website has various functions that are more effective than existing calendar websites, 
however, people also feel like there are a lot of functions of this website that they are not familiar with (keyboard shortcuts).
People are also hesitant on agreeing with people would learn to use this website quickly. Some people suggested there are inconsistencies 
with the website UI.

Suggestion:
Design some functions to provide users with a learning curve, meaning that new users will be able to use the calendar without knowing all the
functions, but able to learn the function along the way. For example, give them a tutorial book on the menu bar, and give them new user functions 
like allowing mouse to drag the event block instead of directly using keyboard to perform function.

Making the UI having the same theme, some users notice the main UI and login UI seem to have different color theme, they want the theme to be more consistent.
